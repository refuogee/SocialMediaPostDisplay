# SocialMediaPostDisplay
Using Google Sheets API to pull Social Media posts and then display them for a client's easy engagement

This uses what I learnt about the Google APIs to pull data from a Google sheet.

This was also a proof of concept and something that so far hasn't needed to be made production ready.

Basically a Google sheet is setup as to the specs of the PHP code needing to pull the data.

I used Elad Shechter's mockup html social feed found here: https://codepen.io/elad2412/pen/GRoJxqG and then tweaked as desired.

What I learnt in this was creating and using HTML Web Components with vanilla Javascript. Basically each post is / was a 'component' that was then created, filled with data from the spreadsheet and pushed to the DOM. Very cool
